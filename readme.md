# Estimating Time Spent on Cars

Following the methodology from CityNerd's video on [Where Driving Consumes the Most of Your Life](https://youtu.be/mUJFptzkdh8). I tried doing the same calculation at the census-tract level.

## Methodology

This metric attempts to measure how much time per day (in hours) a person on average drives and works in order to make money in order to pay for driving expenses, which the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics estimates to be $12,182 per year in 2023](https://www.bts.gov/content/average-cost-owning-and-operating-automobilea-assuming-15000-vehicle-miles-year).

The full details are outlined in CityNerd's video. This video replicates it at a census-tract level
